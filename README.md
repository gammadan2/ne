# osu-droid!plus

osudroid!plus is a [fork of a free-to-play circle clicking rhythm game for Android devices](https://github.com/osudroid/osu-droid). It was a game hatched many years ago by the
[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) community. The project is now being developed by a small group of fans and also with the help of foreign friends.

## Status

osu!droid is under constant development. Features are constantly being added and bugs are constantly being fixed, but
it's playable and fun!

### Building 
<!--
TODO: make a building tutorial
i believe it's the same process?
--->

osu!droid requires Java 17 to build.

In Android Studio, you can `Build` a debug release to test your changes. The output directory of your `.apk` is inside
`build/output` of `osu-droid-plus`'s directory.

If you prefer the command line, and you are on Linux, run `chmod +x gradlew` and `./gradlew assembleDebug` inside the
directory to build the debug `.apk` files.
